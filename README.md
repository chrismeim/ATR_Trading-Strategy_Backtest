ATR Trading Strategy with Backtest

### Summary
Execution and Backtest of Average True Range Trading Strategy in a set of 10 tech stocks

### In Detail
In this excercise I developed, executed and backtested the Average True Range **"ATR"** Trading Strategy.
The concept of this strategy is to **buy** or **sell** break outs of volatile stocks with the hopes that once they break out from their average range they will start to trend in a specific direction

In my analysis I downloaded data from **yfinance API** and developed several functions that helped me to better calculate returns and overall measurments of the strategy.

Aim of this excercise was **not** to perform but to test the overall strategy over a certain period of time under certain conditions
The strategy yielded negative results with a **100% loss of capital** in the overall period
